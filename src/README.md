# 📝 Notes App - Project Folder Structure

This document outlines the structure of the `src` folder in the Notes App project.

---

## 📁 `src/`
The `src` folder contains the main source code for the React-based Notes App. Below is the folder structure:

### 📂 `components/`
This folder contains reusable React components for the Notes App:
- **`Header.js`** – Displays the application header.
- **`NoteForm.js`** – Handles adding and editing notes.
- **`NoteList.js`** – Displays the list of notes.
- **`NoteItem.js`** – Represents a single note item with actions.

---

### 📄 `App.js`
The main application component that acts as the root of the React application. It typically includes:
- Routing logic (if using `react-router-dom`).
- Layout structure (e.g., header and main content).

---

### 📄 `index.css`
The global stylesheet for the application. It includes:
- Base styles (e.g., reset, fonts, colors).
- Utility classes (if not using Bootstrap).

---

### 📄 `index.js`
The entry point for the React application. It typically includes:
- Rendering the `App` component into the DOM.
- Wrapping the app with providers (e.g., Redux, Context API).

---

This structure ensures a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to maintain and scale the project.

## 🛠️ How to Add a New Component
